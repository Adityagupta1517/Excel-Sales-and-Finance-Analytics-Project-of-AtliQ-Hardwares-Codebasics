Excel Sales and Finance Analytics Project for AtliQ Hardware (Codebasics)

Project Objective:
AtliQ Hardware, a leading global company specializing in PCs, printers, mice, and computers, aims to enhance its sales performance and improve net gross margins and profits.

The Sales Director faces challenges with numerous Excel reports from regional managers, which lack actionable insights due to their fragmented nature. This is where a Data Analyst's role becomes crucial in consolidating and analyzing the data.

My Role as a Data Analyst:
This project involved working with a large dataset containing over half a million disorganized sales records. My primary goal was to clean and organize the data (ETL process) and extract valuable insights to guide AtliQ Hardware in making informed decisions and tracking key performance indicators (KPIs). The ultimate objective was to significantly improve the company’s performance, particularly in terms of net sales and gross margin.
